# CreditCardCheck.Python
This is my program wrote for CS50x Pset6 on edX in Python. It checks an user input of a credit card number is valid or not and further evaluates it to the card's corresponding company or lack thereof. The program incorporated mathematical calculation based on Luhnâ€™s Algorithm by Hans Peter Luhn from IBM. Only 4 outputs are available: VISA, AMEX(American Express), MASTERCARD, and INVALID. With the power of python, the program is now ever more succinct and efficient compared to the previous hundreds of lines!
